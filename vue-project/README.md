# vue-project

My first form with Vue3.

You can find code in `src/components/FormComp.vue`

- inheritAttrs: false,

By default inheritAttrs is equal to true.

By default, parent scope attribute bindings that are not recognized as props will "fallthrough". This means that when we have a single-root component, these bindings will be applied to the root element of the child component as normal HTML attributes. When authoring a component that wraps a target element or another component, this may not always be the desired behavior. By setting inheritAttrs to false, this default behavior can be disabled. The attributes are available via the $attrs instance property and can be explicitly bound to a non-root element using v-bind.

Note: this option does not affect class and style bindings.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

```sh
npm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```sh
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

### Lint with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

```sh
npm run lint
```
